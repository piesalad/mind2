# Manually updating the Jolla Mind 2
>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> You will have to look in the community channels (Discord / Sailfisch OS Forum) for the latest RELEASE_TAG, as you will need it below.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To do this you will need root access on the Jolla Mind 2, if you don't have it enabled follow the steps in enable [Developer mode](/developer/enableDevMode)!

>[!CAUTION]
>
>For Version 0.4.2 please follow these instructions https://github.com/venhoai/jolla-mind2/blob/main/UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md.

Open either the Terminal on the Jolla Mind2 or an ssh session and run the commands below.
```bash copy
#Switch to the root user
devel-su
#Enter the venho-ada-env environment
venho-ada-env
#Stop the venho-ada.service
systemctl stop venho-ada.service
#Stop the containers
nerdctl compose down
```
Exiting the venho-ada-env is now needed, as you now will declare the new RELEASE_TAG env Variable.
```bash copy
#Exit the venho-ada-env
exit
#Declaring the new RELEASE_TAG
echo "RELEASE_TAG=X.X.X" > /var/lib/venho-ada/local.env
```
Now you will need to enter the venho-ada-env environment again, update the container images from the registry and restart the venho-ada.service.
```bash copy
#Enter the Venho-ada-env environment
venho-ada-env
#Pull the new Images from the registry
nerdctl compose pull
#Start the venho-ada.service again
systemctl start venho-ada.service
```
You will now need to check if all containers have the status running.
```bash copy
#Check if all containers are running
nerdctl compose ps -a
```
If all containers are running with the new images, you now must prune the old images.
```bash copy
#Remove old images
nerdctl image prune -af
```
