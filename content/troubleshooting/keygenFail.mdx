# If this error occurs the Services where not properly started.

## To fix this:
>[!NOTE]
>
>To fix this you will need Root access on the Jolla Mind 2, if you don`t have it enabeld follow the steps in enable [Developer mode](/developer/enableDevMode)

SSH into the Jolla Mind 2 or open the Terminal on the Jolla Mind 2.<br />

Switch to the root account:
```bash copy
devel-su
```

In the Terminal switch to the venho-ada-env environment:
```bash copy
venho-ada-env
```
then stop the venho-ada service:
```bash copy
systemctl stop venho-ada.service
```
also stop the containers after this with:
```bash copy
nerdctl compose down
```

after running all the commands above start the venho-ada service again:
```bash copy
systemctl start venho-ada.service
```

Now all you have to do is wait, until all Containers are running again and the KEYGEN_FAIL should be gone when logging in.

>[!TIP]

>You can check if all containers are running with
>```bash copy
>nerdctl compose ps -a
