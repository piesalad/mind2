## See logs for each container
Containers directly associated with the Venho app are usually found within the `venho.ai/venho-ada/` image location, although the application might use other containers running as well.
At the time of writing this, the known containers for Venho applications are:

- gateway
- opaque
- keygen
- quadstore
- qdrant
- redis
- ipfs
- llm
- pytorch-transformers
- mailbox-provider
- storage
- ollama
- processor
- venho-ada-frontend-httpd-1

In order to see the logs nerdctl can be used running the following command:

```bash copy
# Switch to root
devel-su
# Switch to venho-ada-env enviorment
venho-ada-env

# See logs for all containers:
nerdctl compose logs -f
# See logs for a specific container (e.g., processor):
nerdctl compose logs -f processor
```
