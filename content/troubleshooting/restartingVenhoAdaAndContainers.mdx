title: Restarting venho-ada.service and all containers
---
If you want to restart everything because you run in to some Trouble, you could either shut down the Jolla Mind 2 or restart venho-ada.service and all containers without needing to turn off the Jolla Mind 2.

## How to restart the venho-ada.service and all containers
>[!NOTE]
>
>To do this you will need root access on the Jolla Mind 2, if you don`t have it enabled follow the steps in enable [Developer mode](/developer/enableDevMode)

SSH into the Jolla Mind 2 or open the Terminal on the Jolla Mind 2.<br />

Switch to the root user:
```bash copy
devel-su
```

In the Terminal switch to the venho-ada-env environment:
```bash copy
venho-ada-env
```
Then stop the venho-ada service:
```bash copy
systemctl stop venho-ada.service
```
Also stop the containers after this with:
```bash copy
nerdctl compose down
```

After running all the commands above start the venho-ada service again:
```bash copy
systemctl start venho-ada.service
```

Now all you have to do is wait, until all containers are running again and the KEYGEN_FAIL should be gone when logging in.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can check if all containers are running with
>```bash copy
>nerdctl ps
>```
