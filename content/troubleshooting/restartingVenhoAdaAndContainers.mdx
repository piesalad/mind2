title: Restarting venho-ada.service and all containers
---
If you want to restart everything, you could either shut down the Jolla Mind 2 or restart venho-ada.service and all containers without needing to turn off the Jolla Mind 2.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To do this you will need root access on the Jolla Mind 2, if you don`t have it enabled follow the steps in enable [Developer mode](/developer/enableDevMode)

SSH into the Jolla Mind 2 or open the Terminal on the Jolla Mind 2. Then run the following commands:
```bash copy
# Switch to the root user:
devel-su
# Switch to the venho-ada-env environment:
venho-ada-env

# Stop the venho-ada service:
systemctl stop venho-ada.service

# Stop all the containers:
nerdctl compose down

# Start the venho-ada service again which will then also start the containers:
systemctl start venho-ada.service
```

Now all you have to do is wait, until all containers are running again and the KEYGEN_FAIL should be gone when logging in.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can check if all containers are running with
>```bash copy
>nerdctl ps
>```
