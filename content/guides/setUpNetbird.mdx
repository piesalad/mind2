<Steps>
    ## Open the Terminal on the Mind 2 or ssh into it
     ```bash
    devel-su
    ```
    to switch to root
    ## Run this one liner to install the netbird client
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
    ```
    ## Activate the client
    ``` bash
    netbird up
    ```
    to start the netbird client a URL will be shown in the Terminal/SSH session , looking like this `https://login.netbird.io/activate?user_code=XXXX-XXXX`open it in the Webbrowser and activate the Device.

    ## That's it
    Now you can access the Mind 2 via `[HOSTNAME].netbird.cloud on any device running the netbird client.
