If you want to add another Ollama LLM model, you can simply search for one on the [Ollama Website](https://ollama.com/search).
>[!NOTE]
>
>To do this you will need root access on the Jolla Mind 2, if you don't have it enabled follow the steps in enable [Developer mode](/developer/enableDevMode)

```bash copy
#Switch to root
devel-su
#Switch to the venho-ada-env Environment
venho-ada-env
```

Then all you will have to do is replace ```'name of the model'``` with the modell you want in the command below.
```bash copy
nerdctl exec -it ollama ollama pull 'name of the model'
```
After that all you will have to do for it to show up in the web GUI is to restart the llm-router.
```bash copy
nerdctl compose restart llm-router
```
