To boot into Recovery Mode, you need to **remove the bottom plate** of your Mind2 device to access the **Recovery** button.

- While **connecting power**, **hold the Recovery button** until the **power button lights up**.
- The Recovery button is the **right-hand side** button (if the power button is facing away from you).
- It is labeled **"RECOVERY"**.
